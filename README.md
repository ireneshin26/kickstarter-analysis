# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview & Purpose of Project
Louise's play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. The purpose of this project was to utilize the Kickstarter data to analyze 1) how different theater/play campaigns did in relation to their launch date and 2) whether their funding goals had an impact on the success rate. 


## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
When analyzing the data for this exercise, it asked us to calculate the percentage of successful, cancelled, and failed theater projects and filtering out any that were live. There were 19 projects with the status of live so when following the instructions, we had to make sure that we excluded this number. 


## Results:

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
1) There were the most theater projects launched in May (166) and June (153) and it is seen that projects had the highest success rate when launched in these two months. May had 166 successful outcomes (67%) and June had 153 successful outcomes (65%).
2) The number of Successful theater project outcomes continues its downward trend after the second half of the year.


### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1) There were the most successful theater projects with a goal range between 1000 to 4999 (388 projects). 


### What are some limitations of this dataset?
There are some limitations to this dataset. Some further data points that would help provide further recommendations:
- Reason a campaign failed
- How was a campaign conducted (e.g. in person, email, social media, etc)

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1) Filter down into the country that Louise is located in. There could be different trends that we may see based on that vs the entire data set.

2) Length of the campaign could also have had an impact in the success rate, especially for the campaigns with higher goals.
